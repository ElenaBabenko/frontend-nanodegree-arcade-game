===============================

* How to start the game
Open index.html in your browser. You will see bugs running across the field from left to right and player in the middle bottom.

* Game Objective
The objective of the game is to move the player all the way up the screen to the blue area without colliding with any of the bugs.
If you do collide with a bug player position will be reset and you will have as many chances as you need to complete the objective.

* How to play
You can only use left, right, up and down arrows to move the player on the screen. You won't be able to step off the game screen.
